## Project Description
Our project intends to provide customers a platform where they can view and order food directedly,
and also a platform where the seller can manage what foods they are selling and also the infomation
(price, photo, category and description) about them.

Our website identifies the seller and customers by their login account. There is only one default
seller. Customers can register through register button.(Default seller account is 123456, password
is 123456)

Our main page has a search bar and food list.

When customers order they food, they can find their favorite food by searching them in the search
bar. They can view their shopping cart. The total price will be shown down in the bottom. The customer
can also empty his shopping cart and delete one of his orders.

When sellers add new food or want to change the displayed information about foods.


## Project 03 Extension
We divided our project into 2 parts, one is for the front end, the other one is for the back end.

First of all, we improved the visualization of our project website by adding colorful graphical background,
buttons and display structures.

Second, we add a login system where you can sign up, login as admin(seller) or customer.

Third, we add actual function to the search bar of main page(phase 2 project didn't finish this function).

Forth, there use to be 3 fixed foods on the main page, now we can add all kinds of food into the database
and they will show in the main page.

Fifth, in the customer order interface, customer can search a specific order by id.

Sixth, in customer shopping cart, customer can delete orders and empty the shopping cart.

Seventh, seller can add food with its information(price, photo and so on)into the database, the food will show in the main page.
